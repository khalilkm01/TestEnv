My Thought Process:
    1) Display the menu sorted under categories
    2) Customer can place an order which is sent to api
    3) There is a second app for the restaurant used to track the following data:
        -Orders
        -Multiple Analytics (Just be adding them in for fun)
    4) The second app can also be used to track resource ordering
    5) This second app also needs to have a direct connection to the third app for restocking
    6) There will be a third app that will be a market place for ordering agric items
    7) I will need to sit down and decide the best course of action regarding the databases
        which can only be done after learning about them. Initially, I will start with a cloud platform.
    8) How will I go about achieving all of this?
        -I need to learn a couple things:
            :Graphql
            :Nodejs
            :Git
            :How to deploy the app

    9) What sort of data will a restaurant want?
        -Revenue for day, week and month
        -Best selling item for each day, week and month
        -Two options of implementation:
            : Each day has a recorded database linking item id with sales and price
            : Each item keeps its data accordingly
        -Looking at it, over the course of time the one that will make sense is each day
            containing its own seperate data 
        -Since we will go by each day having its own data, then week and month will also have their own.
        -The data collected for each day:
            : Item Id: {price,amount}
            : Customer Satisfaction
            : Total Revenue
            : Number of Orders
        -The data collected for each week/month:
            : Customer Satisfaction
            : Total Revenue
        -Data to present:
            : Revenue as compared to previous week/month as a percentage
            : Best selling items, worst selling items (Top 3)

    10) Next steps: 
        -Implement navigation to an orders page
        -Add square as the payment gateway
